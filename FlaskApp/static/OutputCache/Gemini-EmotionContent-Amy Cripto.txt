Here's why:

* **Cynthia's Concern:** The report states that Cynthia is "concerned" about potential gallstones. This concern suggests a level of anxiety and fear about the potential health issue.
* **Potential Surgery:**  The doctor mentioning surgery, even though it might not be immediate, can trigger fear and worry. 
* **Impact on Vacation:**  Cynthia's concern about how gallstones might impact her vacation further reinforces the feeling of fear and worry. 
* **Reassurance:** While the doctor's reassurance is a positive aspect, the initial fear triggered by the potential diagnosis remains significant.
