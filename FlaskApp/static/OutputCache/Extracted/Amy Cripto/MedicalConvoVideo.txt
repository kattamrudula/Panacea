well from what you've told me Cynthia I think the problem might be gallstones now did you have any worries or concerns about what it might be well not really worries I mean I hope it was just indigestion but gallstones doesn't that mean surgery it could be at some point they may have at some point they may have to be removed though and we don't want it to go for too long before it becomes serious but listen it's not an emergency now maybe we can work around that family vacation so tell me where do you plan on going and for how long I will be gone for 2 weeks we're heading down to Mexico with the whole family
